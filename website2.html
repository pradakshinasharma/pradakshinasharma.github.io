    <h2>GLOBAL WARMING/OCEAN WARMING</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  The ocean absorbs most of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, leading to raising ocean temperature.
</li>
  <li>
    Increasing ocean temperature affects marine species and ecosystem. Raising temperature causes coral bleaching and the loss of breeding grounds for marine life and mammals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Raising ocean temperature also affects the benefits which humans derive from ocean, threating food security increasing the prevalence of diseases and causing more extreme weather envents and the lose of coastal protection.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>BLEACHING OF CORAL REEFS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Healthy coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and ecomically valuable ecosystem on earth. Providing source of food for millions. Protect coastline from storms and erosion; provide habitat,  nursery grounds for economically important fish species, provide jobs and imcome to the local economies from fishing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Human impact on coral reefs is significant. Coral reefs are dying around the world
